abstract = "In the late 1920’s a dam was constructed at the south end of BC’s Alouette Lake, cutting off the lake’s outlet to the ocean. This damming event trapped a population of anadromous sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in the lake system and disrupted the habitats present in the lake. Over the course of the intervening century this disruption and the isolation of the system lead to the sockeye developing into a new ‘resident’ ecotype that has a unique phenotype and spawns at depths between 20 and 40 m. New management practices in the early 2000’s have allowed juvenile ‘residents’ to be flushed over the dam and into the outlet, where they migrated out to sea and resumed their anadromous lifestyle, eventually making their way back to the dam. These fish are being transported into the lake, raising the possibility of the two ecotypes interbreeding. To assess this possibility MaxEnt reproductive niche models were constructed for both ecotypes using fish capture records and hydroacoustic tracking data as well as field observations of lake substrate and bathymetry. These niche models were compared via Schoener’s D, a metric of niche similarity, which produced a value of 0.54 (p = 0.04). Schoener’s D ranges from 0 to 1, 0 being complete lack of niche overlap and 1 being complete similarity. The models also had a Spearman’s rank correlation of 0.62 (p = 0.04), which along with the Schoener’s D suggests partial divergence in spawning habitat preferences between the two ecotypes along at least one environmental factor under consideration. This partial divergence may mean that the ecotypes are reproductively isolated, and further studies should be conducted to assess this possibility."
