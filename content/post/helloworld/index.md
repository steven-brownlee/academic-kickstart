You'll have to forgive me, Reader, for using such a cliche to begin this piece but I felt it was only appropriate
considering that this is the first post of the website, and one that I sit writing the HTML code for myself. This 
website is hosted on my personal GitHub page and built using the open-source Hugo platform and the 'Academic' theme.

At the moment content is a bit sparse, with only my CV and some reflective material on my undergraduate experience and
my MGEM capstone project. I hope, in the weeks to come, to start populating this site with more extensive material, 
particularly some of the code I've developed for 599 assignment. In the meantime enjoy what I've posted so far and 
feel free to contact me if you have any questions, comments or concerns.
