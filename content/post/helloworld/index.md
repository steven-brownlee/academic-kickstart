This is my first post and test of the functioning of the blogging system on this website - as is traditional, I've titled it 'Hello, world!' in 
tribute to the generations of computer science students that have come before me and suffered to make producing this website easier.

I'm currently a student in the Master of Geomatics for Environmental Management program at the University of British Columbia, and previously graduated from the University of British Columbia's Okanagan campus with a Bachelor of Science degree. This website was created using the free and open source Hugo Academic platform and hosted on Github. My intention with this page is to use it as a launching point for highlighting the research I've conducted, will be conducting and more generally the comings and goings of my academic career. Thank you for reading this far, and I hope to have much more content soon.
